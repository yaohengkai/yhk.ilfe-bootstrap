Dr. Chang’s expertise is on climate dynamics and climate prediction, as well as global and regional climate modeling. He leads a research group in global and regional climate modeling studies at TAMU and has developed research collaborations with many institutions in the US, Asia and Europe. Dr. Chang’s research involves the understanding of climate variability and predictability, including El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). He has published over 164 refereed journal articles (http://scholar.google.com/citations?User=ciw1niuaaaaj&hl=en), with some of his research being used to guide the design of major international research programs, such as the Climate and Ocean-Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) Research Program (http://www.clivar.org).  He co-chaired the International CLIVAR Atlantic Research Panel (http://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/atlantic) and was a contributing author to three chapters in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He is currently the Director of the International Laboratory for High-Resolution Earth System Prediction (iHESP) at Texas A&M University where he and his collaborators have made ground breaking work on climate modeling and prediction.
